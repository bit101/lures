# Lures

A work-in-progress collection of strange attractor functions.

Attractors... lures... get it?

These are just the functions to do a single iteration of a given attractor. No rendering logic, no other manipulation.

Each attractor function also has a params object that gives the names and default values of that attractor's parameters.
